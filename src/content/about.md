# About Me

#### Most of the things you (maybe) want to know about me

Hey there! My name is Bhaveek Jain and I'm a developer with a passion for all things finance, wellness, and cryptocurrency.

When I'm not busy coding away with ReactJs, NextJs, and the like, you can find me buried in a finance podcast or scouring the stock market (and the cryptocurrency market) for the next big investment. I'm always on the lookout for new opportunities to grow my wealth (and my portfolio).

I'm also fascinated by the world of cryptocurrency and am constantly learning about new coins and the underlying technology. Who knows, maybe one day I'll even come up with my own altcoin! In my spare time, I've even started writing technical blogs to share my knowledge and experiences with others(checkout [Dev.to](https://dev.to/bhaveek)).

But it's not all work and no play for me. I love getting out on the badminton court and hitting some smashes, and I make sure to get my daily run in to stay healthy and fit. Speaking of health, I'm also really interested in nutrition and love learning about all the different foods out there and how they can benefit (or harm) our bodies.

All in all, I'm a well-rounded individual with a love for technology, finance, writing, and living a healthy lifestyle. I'm excited to see where my passions and skills will take me in the future!

That's pretty much everything I know about me yet. In case you know something about me that I still don't, please let me know - I'll add it here.
