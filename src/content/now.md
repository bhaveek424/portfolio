#Now

#### The answer to "What are you upto these days?"

My End Semester exams are over so now I'm in a **beast** mode. I'm planning to learn and incorporate alot of typescript into my projects. There are so many technologies out there which I want to try and build apps on.

Currently, I am building React apps and soon gonna try [Astro](!https://astro.build/) and [Svelte](!https://svelte.dev/).
I'm also preparing myself for job interviews and will be reacing out to companies for jobs. This is it for this month ig, will update it in January now. Bye.
