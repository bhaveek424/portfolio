## bhaveek.me

My personal site made using the [t3 stack](https://create.t3.gg)

## t3 stack

Checkout the repo for [create-t3-app](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app), used to scaffold this project and [init.tips](https://init.tips) to know why you should choose t3 stack. The tech stack consists of -

- Next.js
- tRPC
- Tailwind CSS
- NextAuth.js
- Prisma

My site uses all of these pieces of tech and [Planetscale's free tier](https://planetscale.com) for the database.

## usage

This repo is MIT licensed, so you are free to use the code to create your own site, but please make sure you give proper credits to my own site and link my site in your site. That would help me create more open source projects which could be used by others freely, thank you!
